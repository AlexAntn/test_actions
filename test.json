"description"   : "Hey @robotology/everyone 👋 \n\n\nWe'd like to let you know that we have just published the [**`iCub Tech Docs`**][1], which is by now a handful of instructions that you may find helpful when fiddling with the iCub tendons, especially when you need to replace broken parts. \n\n\nFurther, the same website provides a list of mechanical upgrade kits you can request for your iCub. \n\n\nThese new resources do complement our official documentation and are meant to be ever-growing so that they will likely encompass other important topics in the near future. \n\n\n[Contributions][2] in terms of fixes and new additions are very welcome and very easy to do through [forks and pull-requests][3]. \n\n\nStay tuned 🎧 \n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/documentation \n[2]: https://github.com/icub-tech-iit/documentation/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md \n[3]: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking",

"date"          : "June 2020",
"summary"       : "DynTree 1.1.0 was released today and is now available",
"description"   : "iDynTree 1.1.0 was released today and is now available for download at: https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/releases/tag/v1.1.0 . \n\n\nAs iDynTree adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), the 1.1 is a feature release that is backward compatible with iDynTree 1.0 . \n\n\n## Release Highlights  \n\n\nThis new release introduce two new features: \n\n\n#### New MATLAB based visualizer \n\n\nA new MATLAB iDynTree visualizer (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/682, https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/668) has been added to the iDynTree's [high-level-wrappers](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/tree/v1.1.0/bindings/matlab/%2BiDynTreeWrappers). ![image17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1857049/84040869-753e4500-a9a3-11ea-9c3e-81dfaf1ec505.gif) \n\n\nA tutorial on how to use this new MATLAB visualizer is available in the https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/tree/v1.1.0/bindings/matlab/%2BiDynTreeWrappers#matlab-native-visualization . \n\n\nThanks a lot to Francisco Andrade (@fjandrad) that implemented this feature in https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/668 and https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/682 . \n\n\n####  iDynTree's InverseKinematics MATLAB and Python bindings \n\n\nThe iDynTree's InverseKinematics class has been added to the iDynTree's bindings, so it is now usable from MATLAB and Python bindings. See the  following snippet to have an idea on how to use `iDynTree.InverseKinematics` in MATLAB: \n\n\n ~~~matlab\n\n\nik = iDynTree.InverseKinematics(); \nik.setModel(robotModel); \n\n\n% Set IK tolerances \nik.setCostTolerance(0.001). \n% ik.setCostTolerance(1.0); \nik.setConstraintsTolerance(0.00001); \n% Set targets as cost in the cost function \nik.setDefaultTargetResolutionMode(iDynTree.InverseKinematicsTreatTargetAsConstraintFull); \n% Use roll pitch yaw parametrization for the rotational part of the IK \nik.setRotationParametrization(iDynTree.InverseKinematicsRotationParametrizationRollPitchYaw); \nik.setVerbosity(3); \nik.setDefaultTargetResolutionMode(iDynTree.InverseKinematicsTreatTargetAsConstraintNone); \n\n\n% Add position target  \nik.addPositionTarget(frameIdx, G_targetPos); \n\n\n% --------- Add starting point \n% As the IK optimization problem is a non-linear iterative optimization, the \n% optimization requires a starting point (to be assumed). Be aware \n% that this choice can influence the actual convergence of the algorithm \njointsInitPosInRadians = iDynTree.VectorDynSize(); \njointsInitPosInRadians.zero(); \nik.setFullJointsInitialCondition(G_T_base, jointsInitPosInRadians); \n\n\n% --------- Solve the IK \nif ~ik.solve() \n    fprintf('\n Fail to solve IK!\n') \nend \nG_H_base_optimized          = iDynTree.Transform(); \njointPos_optimizedInRadians = iDynTree.VectorDynSize(); \nik.getFullJointsSolution(G_H_base_optimized, jointPos_optimizedInRadians); \n\n\n ~~~\n\n\nThanks a lot to Lorenzo Rapetti (@lrapetto) that implemented this feature in https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/633 . \n\n\n## Acknowledgements \n\n\nThanks to the contributors (either as code authors, code reviewers or by contributing documentation) of this version of iDynTree:  \n* Francisco Andrade (@fjandrad) \n* Stefano Dafarra (@S-Dafarra) \n* Gabriele Nava (@gabrielenava) \n* Giulio Romualdi (@GiulioRomualdi)  \n* Lorenzo Rapetti (@lrapetti) \n* Claudia Latella (@claudia-lat) \n* Silvio Traversaro (@traversaro) \n\n\n## Detailed ChangeLog  \n\n\n### Added \n- Added a new function to `iDynTreeWrappers` for the function `getWorldTransformsAsHomogeneous`. \n- Added functions for having a MATLAB iDynTree Visualizer in `iDynTreeWrappers`. Some time optimization has been performed (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/659). \n- Added `bindings` for `getWorldTransformsAsHomogeneous` function. \n- Added function `getWorldTransformsAsHomogeneous` that gives a vector of Matrix4x4 based on a vector of strings containing the frame transforms. \n- Added `bindings` for handling `linkSolidShapes` properly (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/issues/656). \n- Added `bindings` for `InverseKinematics` (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/633). \n- Implement `cbegin()` / `cend()` and `begin()` / `end()` methods for `VectorDynSize` and `VectorFixSize` (https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/646). \n- Added CI for MacOS with `IDYNTREE_USES_OCTAVE` `ON`",

"description"   : "Hello @robotology/everyone  👋 \n\n\nThis is to let you know that we have just finalized our **Software Distro 2020.02** 📦 \n\n\nAs already announced in #377, this is a major release that comprises **binary packages** as well. Therefore, follow the [updated instructions][1] available in the wiki to upgrade your system and/or download the new dependencies. \n\n\nYou can find the tags composing this distro in our [Software Versioning Table][5]. \n\n\nThe binaries cover the following platforms: \n- Ubuntu beaver 64-bits. \n- Debian buster 64-bits. \n- Windows 10 64-bits.\n\n\nBe careful since we now strictly require you to: \n1. Install **CMake 3.12** as described in #364. \n1. Rely on [**`YCM`**][2], which is now a mandatory dependency for `icub-main`. You'll find out more details in the [installation instructions][1]. \n\n\n#### ⚠️ Disclaimer \n\n\nWe have changed the way we produce installers for Windows as we now officially make use of [`vcpkg`][3] to handle dependencies. We have been consolidating this process and thus there are still [known issues][4] we are going to definitely fix in the next distro. Should you need help, don't hesitate to get back to us! \n\n\nThis distro is shipped with the updates and fixes reported hereinafter. \n\n\n#### 🆕 Updates \n- All the robots contained in `robots-configuration` are compatible with the latest **Motion Control Version 6**. \n\n\n<details> <summary>⚪ Click to find the robots we specifically upgraded in this distro 🤖</summary> <ul> <li>iCubDarmstadt01</li> <li>iCubEdinburgh01</li> <li>iCubHeidelberg01</li> <li>iCubLausanne02</li> <li>iCubNancy01</li> <li>iCubNottingham01</li> <li>iCubSheffield01</li> <li>iCubSingapore01</li> <li>iCubTwente01</li> <li>iCubHamburg01</li> </ul> </details> \n\n\n- We cleaned up and made `icub-main`  **OpenCV4 ready** as well as a number of sister projects we daily use as `icub-tutorials`, `icub-basic-demos`, `icub-tests`, `iol`, `himrep`, `segmentation` and a few more. \n- We completed the update of `icub-main` to the use of `std::mutex` in place of the deprecated `yarp::os::Mutex`. \n- We extended the _red-ball-demo_ to cover the case of robots where a physical torso is not available like `iCubChemnitz01`: \n- https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration/commit/6bdfec9bb0b427edc5cbd551b76a17aa811c1552 fixed the matrix H0. \n- https://github.com/robotology/robots-configuration/commit/79ec8b1a6106013ac5d86b82ea5c1587b1c4ded4 added custom LIC. \n- https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/commit/facf98981c993bc97b110ff2c5f2facb90794294 allowed `iKinCartesianSolver` to deal with custom LIC, plus fixed handling of direct/reverse order w/ custom kin. \n#### 🐞 Fixes \n- We fixed `WBD` crash caused by `yarp::sig::Vector` move semantic: see https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues/2192. \n- We also fixed spurious crashes of `iCub_SIM` due to an overload of calls to log directives: see https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/issues/637. \n\n\n[1]: https://wiki.icub.org/wiki/ICub_Software_Installation \n[2]: https://github.com/robotology/ycm \n[3]: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg \n[4]: https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/releases/tag/v2020.02 \n[5]: https://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Software_Versioning_Table",
